		<p class="m-4 text-center text-lg">
			OnMyMind is an easy-to-use tracker that allows you to track multiple tasks
			simultaneously. With OnMyMind, you can track the progress of all your
			tasks in one place and better manage your time.
		</p>
		<h2 class="my-4 text-2xl font-bold">How does OnMyMind work?</h2>
		<p class="m-4 text-center text-lg">
			The application allows you to set a timer in the Pomodoro system to
			control your work and break times. Additionally, each task added to
			OnMyMind is equipped with its own timer, which allows you to control the
			time spent on its execution. The goal is to better manage your time and
			organization in difficult conditions.
		</p>
		<h2 class="my-4 text-2xl font-bold">OnMyMind Development</h2>
		<p class="m-4 text-center text-lg">
			I am developing OnMyMind to increase the efficiency of my work, as well as
			for other people who work in similar conditions. I strive to constantly
			improve the functionality and appearance of the application to provide
			users with the best possible experience. In the coming months, I plan to
			add new features such as:
