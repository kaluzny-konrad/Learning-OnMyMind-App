With OnMyMind, you can track the progress of all your tasks in one place and better manage your time. How does OnMyMind work? The application allows you to set a timer in the Pomodoro system to control your work and break times. Additionally, each task added to OnMyMind is equipped with its own timer, which allows you to control the time spent on its execution. The goal is to better manage your time and organization in difficult conditions. OnMyMind Development I am developing OnMyMind to increase the efficiency of my work, as well as for other people who work in similar conditions. I strive to constantly improve the functionality and appearance of the application to provide users with the best possible experience. In the coming months, I plan to add new features such as: The ability to easily change the order of active tasks. The ability to mark task priorities."
